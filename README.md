The Game:
The goal of the game is to defeat the boss at the end of the map in the fastest time possible regardless of the class you choose, so choose which works best with you.
There are items which may seem unreachable, but I suggest testing the functionality of the fences ;).
Revisit some chests to restock before facing off against the final boss.
Monsters get harder as you go.

How to Play:
Use W-A-S-D keys to move in four directions
Hold SPACE to run
Press G for basic attack
Press I for inventory, which also maps keys to more attacks

UP and DOWN arrows control the volume
